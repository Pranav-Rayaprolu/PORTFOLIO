              I'm <strong>Pranav Rayaprolu</strong> from Andhra Pradesh,
              currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
              at
              <strong>Vellore Institute of Technology</strong>. I started my
              academic journey with Java and gradually expanded into web
              development and AI, which led me to intern as an{" "}
              <strong>AI Engineer at INTRAINTECH</strong>, where I worked on
              real-world AI-powered solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of my proudest achievements is building{" "}
              <strong>LifeSync</strong>, a personal companion app that enhances
              work-life balance through intelligent task organization. I also
              developed a smart assistant, similar to Alexa, with
              <strong>contextual awareness</strong>, earning me a{" "}
              <strong>â‚¹3000 cash prize</strong> in a university competition.
              Another project I led focuses on turning meeting discussions into{" "}
              <strong>actionable insights</strong> to improve corporate
              productivity.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm passionate about building{" "}
              <strong>user-centric applications</strong> that solve real-world
              problems. My strengths include a strong{" "}
              <strong>curiosity to learn</strong>, adaptability, and effective
              collaboration. While I strive for perfection in every task, I'm
              actively working on improving <strong>task prioritization</strong>{" "}
              in fast-paced environments.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond tech, I'm an avid <strong>singer</strong>, enjoy{" "}
              <strong>sketching</strong>, and love to{" "}
              <strong>teach and share knowledge</strong>. I'm eager to
              contribute to a <strong>forward-thinking organization</strong>{" "}
              where I can leverage both my technical and management skills while
              growing with emerging technologies.
